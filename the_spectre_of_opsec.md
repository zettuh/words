**security_culture**:

  Intro:
  
  If you are reading this, there is a chance that you've decided that it is time to stop being idle and get out onto the streets and tell the government how you really feel.Fantastic! 
  
  That said, it is crucial that we take steps to keep our identities hidden when going out to voice discontent, as there are actors that would seek to discover our identities and keep tabs on who we are.
  So, what we need to establish is a good Security Culture.  
  This is important as the goal is to minimize risk to yourself and others.
  
  Threat actors that we need to consider in this case include but are not limited to: 
  - Members of law enforcement 
  - white nationalist gangs
  - Republicans. 
  
  These people are not your friends (though they are often friends with each other!), and they do not care about you or your well-being.

  Local/State/Federal authorities have long had a vested interest in seeking out and silencing radicals. 
  This means that radicals ought to be informed on how to avoid giving them anything that can be used to harm others.

  **what_is_it?**:
  
  The central principle of all information security culture, is compartmentalization, aka need-to-know. 
  
     "Three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead."

  **what_does_this_mean?**:
  
  The more people who know something, the greater the chance it falls into the wrong hands. 
     "Loose lips sink ships."
  All Information must be kept on a need-to-know basis.
  In cases where the public is encouraged to join in to add strength in numbers (such as a public rally), some information would have to be shared.
    
  What is crucial here is identifying information is OK to share, and information that must remain secret.
  
  The goal is to help protect those involved by allowing one to maintain plausible deniability should an action or event be deemed punishable by law.
  
  *Examples include, but aren't limited to*:
    - personally identifiable information (PII).  e.g.:
      - SSN
      - physical traits
      - registered call signs
      - Real names
      - Social graph (who's relates to who)
    - physical location addresses that are frequented by your comrades:
      - domicile
      - places of worship
      - favorite restaurants
      - non-public meeting locations
  
  **what_to_do?**:

    - Only ask for information you need to accomplish an objective.
     - If you've done something that your state or the feds deem illegal, do not boast about it, keep it to yourself.
       This include things others have done. It would also be wise to not mention things that are going to happen or might happen if they are considered to be 'illegal'
    - Stay on top of what you are sharing and to whom, though be careful not to leave a written record.

  **what_NOT_to_do?**:

    #### Identify yourself in advance:
      Don't log in to any web site that still works without a user account
         - Google Maps
         - Duck Duck Go search
         - news websites
    - Snitch.
      - Remember: No one talks, everyone walks.
    - Talk about any action taken to anyone, in any means (including meat space).
      - Those who weren't there need plausible deniability.
      - Those who were there don't need to rehash it.
    - Keep a journal (learn from Dread Pirate Roberts)
   some_questions_to_ask_yourself_before_sharing_info:
     - Is this information crucial to my organizing with others?
     - What risks can arise if I divulge this information?
     - Am I potentially putting someone in harm's way if I share this info?
     - Does my sharing this information advance my cause in anyway, and if so, is it worth the risk?


  you_can_say_no:
    Don't answer questions you don't legally have to. Cops, friends, co-workers, doesn't matter. If you are not comfortable with sharing information for safety reasons it is OK to keep it private. Likewise, expect others to do the same.  Feel free to call-in and correct any comrade who appears to be oversharing.

  don't_snitch:
    If you are caught by law enforcement, say nothing to them beyond what's legally required:
      - "Am I Being Detained?"
      - if yes: "I'm invoking my right to counsel and my right to remain silent," and then immediately stop talking, no matter what any officer says to you.

  on_direct_action: (If you are a person or allied with persons that are willing to go a step further beyond just waving a placard and shouting into a megaphone, there are some things to consider)
    - Build a threat matrix/threat model.
      You need to know what needs defending and from whom.  That will help you organize your thinking on how to respond to various scenarios.
      The key piece of knowledge necessary for building defenses for your organization capable of withstanding or surviving external threats is an understanding of the capabilities of your adversaries.
      Consider what your adversaries are capabale of when outlining your action and try to mitigate the risks they pose during the planning phase (some research may be required!)

    - Avoid building patterns.
      This is applicable to where/when you and your comrades meet, targets of said actions, methods you employ, etc.
      Keep it fresh and on a more spontaneous schedule, this includes the frequency at which you meet/are seen together in public.

    - Maintain a low profile.
      Cover your face, know the area where the action is taking place, plan your route/escape routes (if applicable), maintain good comms habits, watch each others backs.
      This also means to be very careful when inviting participants to join you in the planned action: anyone that you invite that doesnt participate is a potential security risk.
      Only bring in people you can *directly* vouch for and trust. (THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT # See the sections on Comms, Logistics, and Breadcrumbs)

    - Don't be hasty and consider the safety of others, always.
      If your action brings more risk/danger to others than reward, it might be worth reconsidering

    - Depending on the action/whether you are caught, investigators will lie about how much they know when interrogating you, and are legally permitted to do so.
      This bluff often leads people to divulge crucial information to the authorities.
      SAY NOTHING beyond invoking your right to silence and an attorney.
      You can lie to state and local cops, legally. You _cannot_ lie to federal law enforcement, that's a federal crime.  DON'T TALK TO COPS.
      The cops are better trained at interrogating than you are at being interrogated.  They hold all the cards in this situation. DON'T TALK TO COPS.

    - There's quote that is fairly well known which goes 'with friends like these, who needs COINTELPRO'
      It's been mentioned already but be absolutely certain you can trust the people you are working with.
      This can potentially serve as a barrier against agent provacteurs sowing mistrust and infighting amongst your group.
      This is typically the tactic employed when your foes can't get acces to your secrets.
      If there is a rumor or report about someone in your ranks, go to the source for confirmation, and hash it out.
      Don't accept rumors as facts and approach the situation diplomatically.
      Pay special attention to reports of misogyny, racism and sexual assault (verbal or otherwise).  A pattern of that behavior
      can indicate an insider trying to sow mistrust.  However, even if they aren't a plant, that kind of behavior will have a
      corrosive effect whose ends will be the same. Root out those kinds of folks once there's a pattern of that behavior.
      "Once is an accident, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action."

comms / social media:
  **the_government_is_spying_on_you**:
     - It should be no secret that the government spies on its citizens.
     - Often indirectly, as they request information about you from the private companies who facilitate our online world.
     - This is a known fact that they have largely failed at keeping out of the public's eye.
     - Given that, it is important as individuals entitled to privacy that we take steps/measures to ensure our communications are kept private and away from prying eyes.
     - Below there will be some steps one can take when attending a rally/protest/demonstration

  **should_I_bring_my_phone**:
     - *NO.*  If you need to communicate with your comrades outside line of sight, there are options that leave fewer traces.
       - your phone will register that you were somewhere near an action. That fact alone has put people away.
       - your social graph will be included in geo-fence warrants.
         - your phone being there will cause others law enforcement can show are connected to you to be targeted for further surveillance.
     - If you absolutely cannot leave your phone at home (family care needs, work related interruptions) and for some reason still want to take action,
       there are steps you can take, outlined below.  But know that you are putting your comrades at greater risk!

  **things_to_do:**
    - Enable full disk encryption on your phone if it didn't come with it on by default. See the guides below to double check and enable if necessary:
      
    - **Android:**
      https://www.howtogeek.com/141953/how-to-encrypt-your-android-phone-and-why-you-might-want-to/

    - **iPhone/iOS:**
      https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-encrypt-your-iphone

    - Disable bio-metric security prior to your attendance.
      Yes, fingerprints and face unlock are convenient, but, law enforcement agents have been known to force people to unlock their phones when using this method.
      - Fingerprints, like your blood alcohol level, eye color, retinal pattern, etc., are all treated as facts about you, not compelled testimony.
        - The Supreme Court has upheld that these actions don't violate your 4th or 5th amendment rights.
      - Cops can hold your phone up to your face or force your finger into the screen, this is legal.
      Pin/Passphrase is the way to go

    - Keep your phone on airplane mode/remove the sim card.
      Unless you absolutely NEED to be connected to a your carrier, avoid doing so.
      Location services on your phone record your whereabouts and the companies that record this data have been shown to hand this data over to anyone with a credit card, let alone law enforcement.

    - Remove any Google/Facebook apps
      (depending on your OS you may just be able to disable the access to location/microphone in the settings such as in iOS https://www.howtogeek.com/211623/how-to-manage-app-permissions-on-your-iphone-or-ipad/

    - Assuming you have your phone on your person, document with photo/video if you see law enforcement being violent.
    - **If you need to contact someone while out: USE. ENCRYPTED. COMMS.**
        - Do not use SMS or a Standard phone call.
        - There are a number of apps that provide solid end-to-end encrypted communications:
          - [Signal](https://signal.org/en/) (preferred, voice, image, and text)
          - [Keybase](https://keybase.io) (better than whatsapp or facebook messenger or SMS)
        - If you are on iOS, iMessage and FaceTime are end-to-end encrypted ONLY with other Apple users.
          - Stick to Signal regardless of platform, this way there's no green bubble surprise.
        - Remember, you want to keep yourself and others safe while minimizing risk

    - Set your lock screen wallpaper to a solid color or a manufacturer supplied default image.
      - A cop could wake your phone and use image search to figure out who the photo of you or your loved one is on your lock screen.

    - Set your ring tone / notification tone to a manufacturer supplied default.
      - no one needs to know that you like a certain musician or certain video game.

    - Disable location tagging on your phone's camera

    - learn how to enable lock-down mode on your phone
       iOS Lockdown Mode: https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120

    - turn off *all* notifications on your lock screen.

    - disable any convenience features related to plugging your phone into your computer.
      - do not auto-connect to storage
      - disable USB debugging

  **things_NOT_to_do:**
    - Do not take photos of others participating on your side without their consent
      - law enforcement and opposing forces are fair game.

    - Take photos of anyone on your side without consent.

    - make vanity posts.
       The goal of one's participation is not for clout or likes, or upvotes, retweets, etc.
       If this is your goal, your head is in the wrong place, and you risk the safety of others. STAY HOME.
    - If you cannot be convinced to not snap a pic and post it, STAY HOME.
    - Do not give over your phone, or it's pin/passphrase to anyone asking for it, for any reason.
    - Do not share details of one's plans unless it's with other organizers and over encrypted messaging.


logistics/planning: #prepping/arriving/leaving
  **bring_the_essentials**:
    When planning day of, think about what you need and bring only those things.
    Below there will be lists, go over them as a general guideline, modify for your own personal needs.

  **how_do_I_look?**:
    A protest/rally/demonstration is not fashion show.
    Ideally you do not want to dress in a way that draws attention to yourself.
    Avoid anything with logos as you'd want to blend in as seamlessly as possible with the crowd while there.
    If you want to be extra cautious, a spare shirt and some accessories can be worth keeping with you when you make your exit in order to not be immediately identifiable as a protestor.
    (you can even thrift a pair of shoes from a thrift store if you are extra paranoid, just make sure it is something you can run in)

  **things_to_bring**: (one might want to consider keeping some of these items with them)
    - Face masks and/or Sunglasses, Balaclavas (if it suits you).
      Wear clothing that covers up identifiable markings/tattoos/logos

    - First Aid supplies.
      Disinfectant, gauze, bandages of various sizes, cotton swabs, nitrile gloves, extra masks, hand sanitizer

    - Water.
      Hydration is super important if you are participating in a march
      (also useful for flushing eyes if cops start dispensing irritants)
      Do not put anything other than water / eyewash in your eyes.
      Do not put anything other than water / eyewash in your eyes.
      Do not put anything other than water / eyewash in your eyes.

    - Depending on the action/threat assessment, a phone or burner phone with spare power (battery packs are typically cheap)
    - A multi-tool.
      Might seem silly, but it can come in handy in a pinch.
      Obviously lookup your local laws with regards to multi-tools/things that have blades.

    - Depending on the action, signs and placards might be worth bringing with you, though, it is not uncommon to find some for you to take when attending a rally/protest/demonstration

    - A clear mind.
      This is not intended to shame anyone using substances of any kind.
      Just avoid using anything that can impair your judgement/reaction times as this can endanger not only yourself, but others as well.
      Once you are home safe whatever you choose to consume is your choice.

    - Some actions might require specific things, determine what these are during planning and bring with them you, cache them near the site.

    - Use an Alias/Handle while at the action.
      Prep one in advance and stick to it.
      Change it for every action.  Those who already know you won't care, and those who don't aren't in need of any persistent identifier.
      Your real name is something that can expose you to risk, so, avoid exposing it to others.  Even just your first name.

  **things_to_leave_at_home**:
    - Illegal substances.
      Pretty self explanatory, if you can get arrested for having it on your person, leave it at home.
      Opened containers of liquor fall into this category.

    - Bad attitude
      Show up with a focused and get ready to make yourself heard.

    - Yourself, if you are not 100% on-board and committed.
      Don't allow yourself to be coerced into doing something you do not want to do.
      Will you get judged? Maybe. Who knows? All I know is that is better for you/others if you avoid showing up to something you don't want to be a part of.
      It's better for you and others if you avoid showing up to something you don't want to be a part of.

    - Depending on the action, young children.
      It can be very cool and empowering to allow your kids to participate in a rally/protest/action, but consider the risk to them if things get violent.
      Use your best judgment and make a decision based on the information you have available. (this also goes for pets!)

    - Jewelry/Expensive items.
      Just don't bring 'em. They can damaged or confiscated, and you may not get them back for months, if at all.

    - Laptops/Tablets/Books.
      You really shouldn't need these things, so, yah know, leave 'em.

    - Anything that you cannot afford to lose, have damaged, be taken from you

  **additional_planning tips**: (things worth doing outside of the above)
    - If attending a protest/rally/demonstration, write the phone number of someone you trust on your person in permenant ink, like a sharpie. Your forearm is a great place to do this, as it will be minimally impacted by sweat/handling things throughout the day.
      Ensure that this person is willing to be called should you be detained.
      Commit it to memory if you can, police have been known to wash arms if they see a number written on them.

    - If attending a protest/rally/demonstration, let someone know who is not attending know where you will be and set a check in time.
      Also, give them an emergency contact number that they can call should you fail to check-in.
      Obviously these should be people you implicitly trust (although the number to a local civil rights lawyer might not be a bad idea)

    - Know your local laws regarding protests/public demonstrations and also refresh yourself on your civil/constitutional rights.
    (https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights/#im-attending-a-protest)

    - Eat a good meal day of. Chances are there might not be a good chance to eat and, depending on the action
      Purchasing food near the action is not the best idea #see the section on Breadcrumbs

  **transportation?: (arriving/leaving)**
    - Know the territory.
      Once you have a location, get a feel for what the area is like, you can use Google maps for this, street view is especially handy.
      During this time make note of any potential exits you can take.
      (depending on your threat model, if you do use google maps, don't be logged in, use a VPN, and search incognito, going even further, use a virtual machine when conducting your research)

    - How you get to the site is really up to you, but there is some general advice worth considering.
      Try and park at least a few blocks away if you drove your vehicle is a good place to start, and preferably in a place that is going to make leaving easy for you.
      Parking too close to a site can lead to your leaving being stymied by foot traffic, roadblocks, etc

    - If you used public transportation/bike/skateboard/any combination of those, plan your routes ahead of time.
      This option also is worth considerong when ones considers the now-widespread existence of automated systems to identify and track license plates


**breadcrumbs: (things that you might leave behind can help your foes. lets avoid leaving a trail breadcrumbs for them to follow)**
  **digital_trails**:
    - These are things that your technology leaves behind:
        - Location data, cell tower data, wifi access hotspots, bluetooth polling.
        - At any given time your phone is recording and broadcasting loads of information about where you are/at what time.
        - Learning to mitigte these risks is important.
        - This goes for after the protest/action as well, don't go posting willy-nilly with tags and such (depending on your threat assessment)
        - Your phone's bluetooth is generally *still enabled* even when in airplane mode, and your phone *will* still ping cell towers

  **physical_trails**:
     - Avoid leaving anything behind that can identify you, whether it be your DNA or otherwise.
       Anything you showed up with, bring it back with you.
       Throw trash away in dumpsters cans away from the site/your home.
     - Try and avoid being caught on CCTV cameras. Or maybe if you feel this is something you are willing to risk, blocking/jamming camera feeds is handy


**general_safety**:
  - use common sense.
  - don't start shit with cops if it brings additional risk to yourself / others (unless literally everyone is down)
  - help those that need it, and overall always consider your personal safety, you are of no good to anyone if you get seriously injured/hurt.
